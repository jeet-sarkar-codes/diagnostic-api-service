# Diagnostic API Service

This project is a basic Python Flask web service that simulates system diagnostics using two REST endpoints. It mimics system health checks often used in real-world monitoring.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python 3.12
- Flask Web Framework
- REST API design (GET)
- GitHub for public tracking

## 🚀 Endpoints

| Route             | Description                   |
|------------------|-------------------------------|
| `/status`         | Returns CPU, RAM, Disk usage |
| `/run-diagnostics`| Returns simulated health report |

## 📁 Project Files
- `app.py` – Flask application
- `README.md` – Project documentation

## 📌 Notes
This project helped me get comfortable with route definitions, `jsonify()`, and running lightweight Flask servers — critical for backend roles.
